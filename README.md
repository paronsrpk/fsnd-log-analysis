# Project: Logs Analysis

## Intro
This program answers the following question from the news database.
1) What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2) Who are the most popular article authors of all time? 
3) On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

To run the program, please follow the following steps.
1) Install Virtualbox. We will use a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server.
2) Install Vagrant which will be used to install and manage the VM.
3) CD into Vagrant subdirectory of this program
4) Start the virtual machine and log in
5) Download the news database [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip).After download, unzip this file. The file inside is called newsdata.sql. Put this file into the vagrant directory.
6) For the First time, you need to load the data by runnig the command "psql -d news -f newsdata.sql"
7) To rund the code, run the command 'python newsdb.py'


## Installation

### Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. [You can download it from virtualbox.org, here.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) Install the _platform package_ for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

Currently (October 2017), the supported version of VirtualBox to install is version 5.1. Newer versions do not work with the current release of Vagrant.

**Ubuntu users:** If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead. Due to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

### Install Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. [Download it from vagrantup.com.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) Install the version for your operating system.

**Windows users:** The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.

![vagrant --version](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584881ee_screen-shot-2016-12-07-at-13.40.43/screen-shot-2016-12-07-at-13.40.43.png)

_If Vagrant is successfully installed, you will be able to run_ `vagrant --version`
_in your terminal to see the version number._
_The shell prompt in your terminal may differ. Here, the_ `$` _sign is the shell prompt._

### Start the virtual machine

From your terminal, inside the **vagrant** subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

_Starting the Ubuntu Linux installation with `vagrant up`._
_This screenshot shows just the beginning of many, many pages of output in a lot of colors._

When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!
